# Insertion Sort


### Objective

In this project, we will cover the fundamentals of an `Insertion Sort Algorithm`, and its operations.


### Problem
Write a method that sorts an array of `characters` using the `Insertion Sort` algorithm. The method should take an unsorted array as input and return the sorted array.

### Implementation
1. Define a method named `insertionSort` that takes an array `['e', 'b', 'd', 'a', 'c']`.
2. Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort the array in `ascending` order.
3. Use a loop to iterate through the array starting from the **second** element.
4. Within the loop, compare the current character with the characters before it, shifting elements to the right until the correct position is found for the current character.
5. Repeat this process for each character in the array until the entire array is sorted.
6. Return the sorted array.

```java
public class Main {

  public static void main(String[] args){

  /* your code here */
	
  }
}
```
